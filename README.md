# moments_v2_backend (Work In Progress)
backend for a sharing app using SpringBoot, Redis, MySQL, and AWS S3.

This is the second version of my project [ShareOurDays](https://github.com/AllenSun-HM/ShareOurDays)'s backend. I added more features like getting most-popular users or posts.
I built this project while learning and using SpringBoot, Redis, and MySQL.

## TODOS
  1. add ElasticSearch for user & post searching feature;
  2. use SpringBoot AOP to complete logging & exception handling feature;
  2. configure MySQL clusters to separate db-read and db-write to MySQL master node and slave node;
